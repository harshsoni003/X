The Start Command is incorrect - you should use `npm run start` in production, not `npm run dev`. The `dev` command is only for local development.

Here are the correct Render settings:

1. Root Directory: Leave it empty (delete any value there)

2. Build Command:
```
npm install && npm run build
```

3. Start Command:
```
npm run start
```

The issue with using `npm run dev`:
- It's meant for development environments
- It includes development-only features and hot reloading
- It's less performant than the production build
- It can cause security issues in production

Your `package.json` already has the correct scripts:
```json:package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev",         // for local development only
    "build": "next build",     // builds production version
    "start": "next start -p ${PORT:-3000}", // for production
    "lint": "next lint"
  }
}
```

Please update your Start Command in Render from `npm run dev` to `npm run start`, then trigger a new deploy. This should resolve your port detection issues and run your application properly in production mode.
